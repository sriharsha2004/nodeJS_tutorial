rendering pages by server :

Usually the normal work flow is : 
When ever user requests the server, the server gets the data from the DB in the form of string (
    we genrally convert object into string to send the data back to user)
and when we hit the request (through browser or postman)
eg : localhost:8081/getstatus
we get {loggedinstatus : true} (or) productdata object
And this data is handed over to client , client will take data and present it in the form of page to 
the user .

Here the concept of server side rendering comes , 
when the server is getting data from DB,, why not the server it self render the pages, insteard
of handing over the data to the client side.
Here for achieving it we use jage/pug templating , and these jade files are genrerally placed into
the folder called as views folder.

But it is not recommmended that to use this concept , because already server is performing 
several tasks like handling user requests , getting data from DB .
If we add one more task of server side rendering pages, then it will give pressure on the server
and its performance will reduce.
Hence we hand over the task to clients to do this task.
