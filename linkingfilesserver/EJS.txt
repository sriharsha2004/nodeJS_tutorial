ejs is Embedded Javascript Templating which is mainly used to load dynamic html webpages
using ejs we can write control statements , other componenets in a ejs page it self

Note : for performing this we need to replace all the html extensions in html pages
with an ejs extension 

working of ejs:
It takes the the ejs file into the server and gives the ejs file to the view engine
which produces the resullting html for the ejs file .

This view engine manages the dynamic content like loops , if statements from the ejs
file and provides a html page (inspect and see)

we can use handlebars/pugs/ejs for this purpose of templating
but we are using ejs

use npm install ejs
