mvc stands for models , views and contollers 
a controller acts as an intermediate between models and views

when we see appwithejs.js fiile we can see that their are several routes in it and also it will become
more difficult later to add new routes 
it becomes more fussy , hence we include all the request handlers in seperate folder componenets say 
(controllers)
here we create a folder componenets and make file blogcontollers.js which contains all the request 
handlers to provide the response to user

and also we are using a folder know as expressRouter which contains all the routes
expressRouter is used when all the routes contain the common route then insteard of specifying the 
same route again and again and also if we want to change the route we can replace only one 
time insteard of again and again.
