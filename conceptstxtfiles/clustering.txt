clustering is a concept used to increase the performace of the server using which the server, can
handle requests in a faster manner.
In the clustering concept we create a virtual copy of server , which is same as original server,
which it can also handle requests of users .

hence by using clustering we are creating virtual servers ,hence all the servers can handle the 
requests at the same time ,

But their is a limit for creating virtual servers, it depends on our configuration of cpu like 
RAM,processor (i3,i5,i7 ) etc...
Inorder to know the number of virtual servers our system is capable of creating 
we use additional module known as os module
Usually we use the cluster module to create a cluster .
os module to know the number of servers or cpus we can create .
Ususlly websites like amazon create hundreds of virtual servers to increase the performance.

implementation :
Refer onlineshoppingapp
reuquire("cluster") module .
noofcpu = require("os").cpus.length()

if(cluster.isMaster){
    for(int i=0;i<noofCPu;i++){
        cluster.fork(); //used to create virtual server for the master server.
    }
}else{
    //server related code
    //app.use ....
    ..
}

Note: When ever we create a copy , we only create a copy only for original server, 
only if cluster.isMaster we create copy for that
when ever a copy is created again that server copy will execute all statements from starting of
server.js , this time it will execute the else part ,as it is not master.
Same repeats for all the virtual servvers or cpus;
